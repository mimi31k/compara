This file describes how to create an image with our species tree.

First, we need to re-scale the tree in order to improve the readability.
We use a log-scale and make internal branches slightly smaller than final
ones:

more ../../scripts/pipeline/species_tree_blength.nh | \
  perl -e '$_ =~ s/\)\w+/\)/g;
    $_ =~ s/\?\w+/XXXXXXXXXXX/g;
    my @a = split(/([\)\,])/, $_);
    foreach my $a (@a) {
      if ($a =~ /(.*\w\:)(\d\.\d+)(.*)/) {
        print $1, log(1.6+$2), $3; # final branches, make them slightly larger than...
      } elsif ($a =~ /(.*)(\d\.\d+)(.*)/) {
        print $1, log(1.2+$2), $3; # ... internal branches
      } else {
        print $a;
      }
    }' -n > species_tree.nw

Open Dendroscope. Load the file and select the Radial Phylogram (Ctrl+7).
- In the view menu, deselect "Sparse labels" and choose "Radial labels".
- Adjust the tree, by rotating it left or right.
- Remove species not in e! by selecting them and Ctrl+Backspace (their names show as XXXXX.n)
- Rotate nodes with Ctrl+Shift+T if you wish (Cionas tend to get on the internal side after removing mosquitoes)

If you want to let Dendroscope load the figures automatically, do:
cd ~/src/public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/i/species/48/
cvs up -dP
mkdir ~/tmp/species_tree_imgs
ls *.png | while read i; do \
  cp $i ~/tmp/species_tree_imgs/$i; done
And go to Options -> Load Taxon Images...
You can change the size of the images in Options -> Set Image Size...

Save the file as an SVG and edit it to replace the images as they usually overlap one another.

Tips:
1. Use inkscape (from the GNOME project) for relocation the taxa images. Use Ctrl+Shift+G to ungroup all in order to move the images freely.
2. Add "Image obtained using Dendroscope (D.H. Huson and C Scornavacca, Dendroscope 3: An interactive tool for rooted phylogenetic trees and networks, Systematic Biology, 2012)" at the bottom of the image
3. Open with Karbon (from the KOffice project) to export the image into a PDF and into a PNG. Remember to shrink the drawing area, especially before exporting to a PNG.

Using inkspace, the resulting PDF might get rotate 90 degrees. Go to the properties of the image and specify the dimensions manually.

Commit the SVG, PDF and PNG in this directory.

To get the PDF accessible from the webpage, you must also commit the PDF file into
public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/info/about/ (Check that the file is there and email the webteam otherwise).
